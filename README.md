Stock Market Analysis Webapp
This project is about creating a stockmarketanalysis webapp using as simple python code as possible in which you we get information about the stock prices with their real tiime values with graph representing their peaks and downfalls of a particular stock for a particular day or a week or a month.
This code takes us to a local domain to view the data and the graphs.
And through these values and graphs you can predict the future of a particular stock.
